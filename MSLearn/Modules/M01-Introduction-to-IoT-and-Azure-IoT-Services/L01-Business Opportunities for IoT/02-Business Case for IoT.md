# Business Case

In some ways, the core value proposition of IoT has been around for centuries. Even before the advent of the Internet, people have been, out of necessity, using data to make decisions. A shop owner keeps an eye on inventory to determine what people tend to buy and ensures her shop is well stocked with those items. Engineers examine bridges or dams for early signs of failure and use that information to anticipate upcoming repairs and budgets for those repairs. A commuter watches the morning news for information about which route to work might be the quickest.

The promise of IoT is to:

* instrument the things around us (everything from cars to bridge parts to jewelry)
* collect, store, and analyze the data associated with these things
* generate real-time intelligence pertaining to items that we care about

Microsoft characterizes this "promise" in terms of things, insights, and actions:

> IoT applications can be described as Things (or devices), sending data or events that are used to generate Insights, which are used to generate Actions to help improve a business or process.  An example is an engine (a thing), sending pressure and temperature data that is used to evaluate whether the engine is performing as expected (an insight), which is used to proactively prioritize the maintenance schedule for the engine (an action).

In the sections below we examine the business and social impact that IoT can have and we look at the ways that IoT technology is being implemented.

## The Current and Future Impact of IoT

The IEEE has compiled data and makes the following claims [1] about its current and future impact:

* In 2015, the global wearables market had already increased 223% from the previous year (and data on IDC shows it grew by another 31.4% in Q4 of 2018 alone) [2]
* By 2020, 250 million vehicles will be connected to the Internet
* IoT will add 15 trillion dollars to the global economy over the next 20 years
* There will be 50 billion Internet-connected devices by the year 2020.

As the market becomes more mature, these figures will no doubt change but the current trend looks as if IoT is not only here to stay but positioned to make a substantial impact both socially, in business, and economically.

## Where the Technology is Headed

As with any new technology, predicting where it will go is difficult since advances in production, new innovations, and unexpected disrupter all have an impact. Given current trends it looks like Internet-connected devices will be as common place as the integrated circuit in years to come. In 2008, SRI Consulting Business Intelligence and the United States National Intelligence Council created the diagram below as a roadmap of where IoT would be headed. While the pacing of the advances may be inaccurate, the diagram does illustrate a fairly accurate picture of how IoT is advancing.

Of course, the success of IoT will not rely solely on advances in device technology or even cloud services (though advances in both are essential). Omar Valdez-de-Leon, in a 2017 article [3] for the IEEE focuses on 6 areas that will require investment as IoT technology advances:

1. **Platforms**. Platform development will enable developing solutions easier and enable both market verticals and a marketplace.

2. **APIs** (application programming interfaces). Valdez-de-Leon claims that, "APIs are the basic building blocks of an IoT ecosystem" and argues that building robust and market-friendly APIs will help create or ultimately destroy the market effects that will be essential for IoT adoption.

3. **Communities** Strong partner communities will enable IoT systems to inter-operate and that will create a true ecosystem around the technology. Proprietary and isolated systems will stifle growth.

4. **Branded Services** True to the open source model, some companies can demonstrate a commitment to the technology and find ways to make money by branding products (sometimes called "white labeling") using partner technology.

5. **Revenue Models** Generating revenue for IoT products and services will involve thinking differently about how to work with partners and pricing.

6. **Support** Often overlooked, ongoing maintenance of partner relationships, updating aging models, and ensuring partners support their products and services will be key to ensuring IoT moves beyond an interesting idea to becoming a part of the technological ecosystem.

## Business Opportunities

When you hear IoT described, you might be inclined to think about the products and services you interact with on a daily basis--what business people call "consumer products." The Nest thermostat might come to mind because it is a product that is regularly held up as a paradigm case of an Internet-connected device. The hardware uses data to make decisions about how you want your home heated or cooled, gives you reports on how you're using energy, and interacts with other services to report on the weather outside your home.

But IoT is being adopted by businesses of all sizes to enable a host of productivity gains, make products safer and less prone to error, and build more efficient machines. Microsoft has highlighted specific use cases to illustrate how the technology is being adopted to enable companies to run their businesses. The German company [Bosch describes](https://www.bosch.com/explore-and-experience/internet-of-things/) IoT in terms of outcome--what connected devices can produce.  

Here is a sample of how IoT can benefit businesses and create new opportunities for companies adopting the technology.

### IoT for manufacturing

Microsoft [highlights](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-of-things/manufacturing) the following benefits for implementing IoT solutions in a manufacturing scenario:

* **Improved visibility across your manufacturing operations**—make more informed decisions with a real-time picture of operational status
* **Improved utilization**—maximize asset performance and uptime with the visibility required for central monitoring and management
* **Reduced waste**—take faster action to reduce or prevent certain forms of waste, thanks to insight on key production metrics
* **Targeted cost savings**—benchmark resource usage and identify inefficiencies to support operational improvements
* **Improved quality**—detect and prevent quality problems by finding and addressing equipment issues sooner

Each of these items can enable a manufacturer to improve efficiency and reduce waste, increase safety (for both workers and customers), help drive profitability by using real-time data to make decisions and, with automation, make real-time adjustments to processes.

### IoT-enabled Smart City

Telecom company AT&T [describes](https://www.business.att.com/content/productbrochures/iot-digital-infrastructure-brief.pdf) the following benefits of a city fitted with smart devices that provide real-time data on things like parking, traffic, violent activities, and air quality:

* Enhanced citizen safety
* Optimized public services
* Economic growth
* Improved traffic flow
* Improved environment
* Empowered civic engagement

Businesses can use data from these systems to improve products, innovate on new products to meet needs that may have been hidden or unknown without the data, and help cities solve seemingly intractable problems.

Here's an example. The popular traffic app Waze enables users to report on road situations in real-time like the existence of a dangerous pothole or other hazardous conditions. That data could be used by city officials to develop maintenance plans to address issues like these in more efficient ways that improve public safety. While this does involve some user interaction, it's easy to see how cars or street lamps could be fitted with artificial intelligence systems to detect conditions like these and report them in an automated way.

### IoT-enabled Retail

Analytics company SAS reports that IoT is starting to find its way into the retail experience. Using devices like RFID tags, mobile devices, and even digital signs, retail is embracing the advantages IoT can provide. The [SAS report](https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/articles/big-data/five-iot-applications-retailers-are-using-today.html) highlights five places where retail is using IoT to enhance their business and customer's experience:

1. **Predictive Equipment Maintenance**. As we've talked about, equipment, like refrigerators or point-of-sale devices, that are instrumented with IoT devices can help manufacturers predict failures and alert service staff when equipment needs to be maintained.

2. **Smart Transportation**. Internet-connected trucks and even products can help optimize the logistics around getting goods from one place to another.

3. **Data-aware Warehouses**. Retailers can outfit their warehouses with sensors and inventory tags so product placement in the warehouse can be optimized for easier access and quicker delivery. SAS anticipates that using automation, warehouses will "self-organize" to be the most optimal at all times.

4. **Connected Consumer**. Gone will be the days of mass marketing. Being aware of who is in your store can help you optimize sales or promotions to meet the needs of individual shoppers. Shoppers benefit because they can get a sale price on products that matter to them.

5. **Smart Store**. Imagine a mall that uses IoT to determine how customers shop and then enable mall planners to place stores that optimize around those patterns. SAS expects that this is on its way.

## IoT Adoption

In the previous section, we talked about the opportunities business can take advantage of by adopting IoT solutions. While much of that is forward-looking, you may have come to see that IoT already is being adopted by many businesses and consumers.

* In a [2018 blog post](https://blogs.microsoft.com/iot/2018/06/05/smart-buildings-are-built-on-azure-iot/), Microsoft gave an overview of companies that are starting to use IoT solutions (specifically built on Azure IoT) in what they call "Smart Buildings." These companies are using IoT technology to help people navigate buildings, trigger maintenance requests, help engineers design better buildings and help property managers oversee their properties in a more efficient and effective way.

* Technology company Intel is working with many companies to enable IoT solutions. Intel [describes solutions](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/internet-of-things/solution-blueprints-and-case-studies.html) that range from building smarter trains to smarter roads. They've helped a plastics company determine inefficiencies in their control system as well as improve their product cycle and reduce inventory risks. Intel's "wearables" solutions "improve worker efficiency and safety, including hands-free operations of industrial equipment."

## Opportunities Abound

Whether its connecting a thermostat in your home or improving the efficiency of a jet engine, IoT solutions are the next big wave in technological advancement. Businesses already have begun to adopt IoT technology and the need for IoT architects and engineers will be growing over the next decade. Come join the revolution!
