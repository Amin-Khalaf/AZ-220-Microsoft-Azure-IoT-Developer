# Demo - Business Models for IoT

This instructor-led activity investigates the different approaches a business can take in the transition to IoT. 

You will be moving quickly through a guide that Microsoft has assembled that is intended to help students understand how IoT can benefit a business. Having students think about a business that they regularly engage with and can relate to (for example, a service company or utilities provider) may be helpful. You can refer to this company or business as you navigate through the guide. 

As you progress through the guide, you will have the opportunity to point out questions that students should consider when they work on a business model for their own IoT solution.

1. Open your web browser and then navigate to [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/iot-business-models](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/iot-business-models/)

    > **Note:** It is strongly recommended that student go back and review this content online in its entirety. If you or student are unable to access the content in your region, review the extract at the bottom of this topic.

2. Click **Download**

3. To unlock **Section 1** of the content, click **Section 1: IoT strategy**

    Briefly introduce the page - **Success with IoT starts with the right strategy**

4. Point out each of the topics listed under **Four pillars of what IoT can do for your business**

5. Point out the topics listed under **Three things to look for in a good business model**

    You don't need to open them during the demo, but you can let students know that they can return to this resource later.

6. Tell students that they should consider the following questions when they think about a business model for their solution. 

    * When you think about your business, which of the four pillars would be most relevant?

    * Based on your answer to the question above, in what ways could you implement that pillar to improve your business? 

        Have them think specifically of goals an IoT solution could help them reach or problems it could help them solve in that specific area.

7. At the bottom of the page, click **Continue to the Next Section**

    The **Choose the right IoT-enabled business model** page will open.

    Quickly explain that this page discusses the ways that companies can get value from an IoT solution. 

    The graph shows business value separated along two axes:

    * the 'Y' axis shows "pricing power" (the ability to aggressively and competitively price products and services)
    * the 'X' axis shows "revenue recurrence" (the ability to generate regular and consistent revenue)

    The six business models listed below the graph are displayed relative to the two axes. Each business model provides a different value depending on what you want to accomplish.

8. Point out that each of the business model topics is listed under the **Which IoT-enabled business model is right for you?** section title. 

    These topics open to define each of the models in the chart and describe their pros and cons.

    You don't need to open them now, but let student know that they can come back and review this content later.

    Tell students that when they read through the topics, they should think about what they decided about how they want to improve their business from the first section and use those goals or problems to solve as a way to filter the business models in this section. Ideally, they'll want to focus on one or two of the models described on the page. It's generally not possible to do everything described there all at once. 

9. Tell students that they need to consider the following questions as they develop your business model:

    * Which business model best applied to the goals you want to reach or problems you want to solve for your business? Why did you choose that model? Be as specific as you can as you can use your answer to define how you will implement an IoT solution to address your business needs.

    * Would more than one model work for your business? If so, in what order would you implement the model for your business and why? Answering these questions can help you develop a long-term approach to your IoT solution. You may want to implement more than one business model in stages depending on the needs of your business.

    * Are there business models described on the page that would be out of scope for your IoT solution? If so, why wouldn't you include them? Answering these questions will help refine what architects call "non-goals"--things you want to make sure don't distract you from focusing on what is important.

10. Now click **Continue to the next section** at the bottom of the page.

    The page **Start your IoT Engines** will open.

    Briefly introduce this page, which is about action: how you will get started building a business model around IoT. 

    While this guide is focused specifically on Microsoft's offering, encourage students to consider how they would implement IoT as a general technology solution for the business they're considering as they are getting started. 
    
11. Tell students that as they are putting together an IoT-enabled business model, they should use the information that they gathered in the previous sections to describe the following:

    1. The goals you want to achieve and the problems you want to solve with IoT as it relates to your specific business.

    2. The relationship between cost and benefit in implementing an IoT solution. This will involve analyzing all the resources and expenditures you'll need for an IoT solution and whether the benefits your business will derive from implementing the solution will offset those costs. (You'll be working through a couple of laps in upcoming lessons where you'll have an opportunity to practice this.)

    3. How you will "sell" an IoT solution to business stakeholders and partners. While an IoT-enabled business may sound "modern" in theory, a solid business model will have to show why an IoT solution makes sense for your business. This is related to the previous consideration on cost but this consideration goes beyond cost and involves things like company culture, core values and priorities, and similar aspects. Your business model should address these considerations.

    4. How your IoT solution will be perceived by your customers. You may have to consider if an IoT solution is good for your business overall even if it makes financial sense. For example, some businesses may work with customers who are unfamiliar with or skeptical of using devices that collect data. You may have to consider if implementing IoT for your customers would be _perceived_ as a security or privacy risk even if no real risk is involved. You'll have to consider how to message this.

    5. What you need to get started. A solid business model will address the specific steps involved in getting an IoT solution off the ground. As we saw in earlier lessons in this module, this will involve a prototyping and testing phase as well as a full analysis of the costs, the team needed, and how the project will progress once the initial stage is complete.

    6. How you maintain the solution over the long term. We studied this in previous lessons in the course and this consideration involves taking a long-term approach to an IoT solution. A business model should not only address the immediate concerns of getting a solution implemented but how the business will maintain and operationalize the solution over the long term.

## Content Extract

The following content is extracted from https://discover.microsoft.com/azure-iot-business-model/iot-strategy/ to ensure learners can access the information should they be blocked based upon their region.

## Four pillars of what IoT can do for your business

* **Engage your customers** > Deliver personalized, rich, connected experiences in journeys your customers choose.
* **Empower your employees** > Keep up with your fast-moving customers by giving your employees efficient tools to help them anticipate and meet customer demands.
* **Optimize your operations** > Increase the flow of information across your entire operation, better manage your resources, and keep your business processes synchronized.

* **Transform your products** > Expand the reach of your business, anticipate customer needs, understand how the products you manufacture are used, and quickly develop and improve them.

## Three things to look at in a good business model

* **Align with company goals** > Businesses approach IoT in many ways. The business model you choose should generate the most profit, as well as reflect the intricacies of your industry and the priorities of your company.
* **It's self-reinforcing** > The choices executives make while creating a business model should complement one another. When that’s the case, the business model creates a virtuous cycle that continuously builds upon resulting successes.
* **It's robust** > A good business model should be able to sustain its effectiveness over time by fending off threats such as imitation, substitution, organizational complacency, and customers’ inability to flex their bargaining power.

## Which IoT-enabled business model is right for you?

There are many business models to choose from based on how often you want to interact with and collect revenue from your customers and your market pricing power. Below, we define six business models and offer key considerations for each, as well as examples of companies that have evolved their business models as they embraced IoT technology.

This is by no means an exhaustive list of business models. Look to these six models as thought starters for determining how IoT can help you evolve your business approach. Any of these can be tweaked or combined to make IoT reap the most possible value for you based on where you fall on the revenue and pricing power matrix above.

### 1. Margin optimization

#### What is it?

Just because you sell a commodity doesn’t mean you can’t gain significant value from IoT. Companies that don’t have pricing power can improve margins through improved efficiency rather than changing how they collect revenue.

![Margin Optimization Diagram](../../Linked_Image_Files/M01_L01_MarginOptimization.png)

#### Pros

You don’t need to change how you interact with customers and how you go to market. All the changes happen behind the scenes and your customers will never know the difference.

#### Cons

There is a limit to how low you can go. You’ll never get rid of all your costs, so, at some point, you’ll get diminishing marginal returns on your cost-saving investments.

#### When does this model work well?

This model works well for manufacturing companies of commoditized products. That’s because it enables cost savings and gives you better margins without passing costs along to customers.

**Key factors to consider in choosing this business model:**

* **Customer willingness to accept change**. With this business model, there’s typically no change to how you interact with your customers. They often never even know that anything substantive has changed in your business. If you worry that your customers will not be open to change, this is a good way to get value from IoT with little to no impact on your customer relationships.

* **Just getting started with IoT**. Focusing on efficiency is a great starting point to getting ROI from IoT. As your company’s IoT solution scales and the company is better able to leverage customer data, you can focus on efficiency to improve margins and capture even more value through new, future revenue sources by employing the tactics described in other business models later in this e-book.

##### Who does it well?

World-class design and manufacturing solution provider Jabil is a great example of focusing on efficiency. The company turned to Microsoft for machine learning and predictive analytics that connect its factory floor to the cloud, reduce unplanned maintenance costs and downtime, and increase agility to meet customer demands.

### 2. High-end SKU

#### What is it?

If you can differentiate your product or service from the competition, you can charge a premium for your higher-end offering. The business that chooses this model will have to decide where on the price spectrum it wants to fall based on its customers’ willingness to pay.

![High-end SKU diagram](../../Linked_Image_Files/M01_L01_HighEndSku.png)

#### Pros

As a unique offering, you can set the tone for pricing in your category. You get high margins, which you can use to further develop high-end or high-margin products.

#### Cons

You risk changing your brand image and alienating existing customers if you charge too much. You also risk setting your price point too high and missing the sweet spot of your customers’ demand curve.

#### When does this model work well?

This model works well when you can clearly differentiate yourself from the competition. You can charge a higher price because your connected product is unique. The main thing you’ll need to decide is whether you want to charge a very high price and serve just the niche that most values your product, or price more modestly to get higher volume.

**Key factors to consider in choosing this business model:**

* **Customer demand for your niche**. Are there customers asking for the features that you uniquely offer? Are they willing to pay more because you offer those unique features?

* **Barriers to entry**. Are you the only company that can meet your customers’ needs? Is your current differentiator hard for others to copy? If competitors can easily replicate what currently makes you unique and charge a little less, you will lose your ability to charge a premium.

#### Who does it well?

Luxury connected car brands have found success with this business model. From sensors that enable the car to drive itself to touchscreen consoles enabling control of many car systems, IoT creates a high-end driving experience that customers will pay a premium for over other car brands.

*Selling a high-end SKU can also be coupled with a high-end service contract, as you’ll see in the value-added services section below.*

### 3. Fremium

#### What is it?

With the freemium model, the base level of service is free, but improved customer service add-ons can be a gateway to new revenue opportunities. You recognize that some customers won’t ever pay, but you still get value from improving your brand, gaining customer loyalty, and having a larger customer base.

![Freemium Diagram](../../Linked_Image_Files/M01_L01_Freemium.png)

#### Pros

Because your product is free, you cast a wide net and can capture a lot of potential paying customers. Even if those customers never pay for your product, they become more familiar with your brand and your other product offerings.

#### Cons

You run the risk of never getting your customers to pay. If you don’t offer paid add-ons that are sufficiently appealing, customers will continue to use your free offering and never be compelled to pay, which is unsustainable for you in the long run.

#### When does this model work well?

This model works well when most of your customers are price sensitive and unlikely to give your product a try if it means paying above-market prices. It’s also great for generating word-of-mouth marketing exposure from customers excited about getting your product for free. If you can find indirect ways to subsidize non-paying users (e.g., advertising, charges for attractive upgrades), then this might be a good fit for you.

**Key factors to consider in choosing this business model:**

* **Willingness to accept some losses up front.** There will inevitably be a subset of customers who never pay for your product. They use the free services you offer and never pay for the premium upgrades. Taking a freemium approach to doing business requires that you are able to accept the risk associated with non-paying customers.

* **Sufficiently attractive upgrades**. Monetization requires that customers pay for your premium add-ons. Thus, those upgrades have to be attractive enough that customers are willing to pay for them rather than just staying with the free offering.

#### Who does it well?

One company that uses this model is SkyAlert. It’s one of just four companies in the world providing an early-warning system that alerts people about impending earthquakes via a mobile app, standalone devices, and an IoT solution that runs in Microsoft Azure.

Its basic app is free, but in-app purchases for premium features and services allow for attractive, data-driven add-on opportunities. In production for just two months, the mobile app already has 5.8 million users, and more than 40 organizations, including Fortune 50 companies and schools, are using the standalone devices.4

The Emirates Air Line cable car, owned by Transport for London, took a similar approach to monetizing IoT for its service that runs across the Thames River. Employing Microsoft Azure and other technologies, the transit authority provides free Wi-Fi service to passengers. In addition to enhancing customer service, free Wi-Fi created new revenue opportunities while allowing Transport for London to obtain accurate and timely insights on the operations of the cable car.


*The paid upgrade component of this business model can be a service, in which case this model looks similar to the value-added product service option.*

### 4. Razor and blade

#### What is it?

Razor and blade is also known as the “lock-in” model because the product you’re selling is simply a stepping stone into your brand’s ecosystem, thereby guaranteeing future revenue via brand loyalty and a larger customer base.

![Razor and blade diagram](../../Linked_Image_Files/M01_L01_RazorAndBlade.png)

#### Pros

You get more customers trying your product because of the low upfront cost. Once customers are in your ecosystem, they are likely to stay because of the upfront commitment and, over time, brand familiarity.

#### Cons

If a competitor is able to replicate or at least closely proxy your “blades,” it will erode the high margins you can reap from future purchases.

#### When does this model work well?

This model works well when your customers are not willing or able to pay a large lump sum for your product upfront. If you can afford to take a loss on the first piece of hardware sold and recoup those losses through sales of future “blades,” this might be a good model for you.

**Key factors to consider in choosing this business model:**

* **Need for an ecosystem.** Can your customer use your “razor” on its own in perpetuity? If so, they won’t buy your “blades” and you will not recoup the losses you take by selling your central piece of hardware at or below cost.

* **Uniqueness of your “blades.”** Can competitors easily copy the complementary hardware components through which you plan to recoup any losses you take on your “razor”? If so, you can’t depend on that blade as a steady revenue stream.

#### Who does it well?

Some of the biggest affordable smart home systems employ this model. These systems consist of sensors, smart light bulbs, smart plugs, a thermostat, and a smartphone app that works with a central hub to control everything. The upfront cost for customers is quite low, but they’re expected to sign annual contracts, and additional hardware comes at a premium.

*The blade in this model can be ongoing service contracts, in which case this model looks similar to the value-added services business model but involves taking a loss when selling the product.*

### 5. Subscription Service

#### What is it?

This is another recurring revenue model where the customer pays a per-user, per-device, or per-use subscription fee for access to the benefits of whatever you’re offering, regardless of usage. Ultimately, this means you can bank on a regular, steady income stream.

![Subscription Service](../../Linked_Image_Files/M01_L01_SubscriptionModel.png)

#### Pros

Income will continue flowing for as long as customers see the value. Customers never stop being your customer, so there are no costly sales cycles.

#### Cons

Without an upfront investment, customers are not tied to your service. They can easily move to another competitor as soon as they stop seeing the value of your service. Even with contract terms, you are much more reliant on customer satisfaction to drive revenue.

#### When does this model work well?

This model works for companies that can accept not having locked-in, upfront revenue and can accept variable income received periodically as customers continue to use a product. This is often the case with companies that shift from predominantly selling products to selling an equivalent service, because labor is a variable cost driven by demand for the service.

This model also requires that your IoT solution give you sufficient insight into how much customers are consuming, so you can track whether customers are actually using their subscriptions.

**Key factors to consider in choosing this business model:**

* **Monitoring customer utilization and demonstrating value.** Customers who are paying for subscriptions they aren’t using won’t be paying customers for long. In such cases, the key is to track whether your customers are using the services they are paying for and focusing on customer retention.

* **Choosing a unit of measure.** Subscriptions are paid on a per-unit basis. You can charge per user, per hour of use, etc. Charging your customers by user offers them more predictability because they’ll know exactly how much they’ll pay, regardless of how much they use. However, if your customers are not engaged and actively using your product, they may churn because they’re paying for more than the value they derive from the product. Charging for usage, on the other hand, makes charges to your customers more variable but can save them money during periods when their usage is low.

#### Who does it well?

Rolls-Royce has more than 13,000 engines for commercial aircraft in service around the world and offers customers comprehensive engine maintenance services that help keep aircraft available and efficient. The company employs a “power by the hour” model in which customers pay based on engine flying hours.

By moving from a fixed-cost model to a variable-cost model, Rolls-Royce is earning more revenue and transforming how it uses data to better manage customers’ engine maintenance and maximize aircraft availability.

### 6. Value-added services

#### What is it?

This is one of the most popular IoT business models because it supplements product sales with service contracts. You continue selling products, but you can now also sell your customers services, creating a whole new revenue stream.

This model builds upon either focus on efficiency or high-end SKU by both selling products upfront and monetizing the servicing of those products.

![Value Added Service Model](../../Linked_Image_Files/M01_L01_ValueAdded.png)

#### Pros

With a post-sale customer relationship, you don’t have to rebuild a relationship that had been dormant between sales cycles when you think the customer is ready for a new purchase.

#### Cons

This model requires a completely different skill set for servicing than for manufacturing and sales. The added labor costs required to offer servicing increases your operating expenses, so the added variable revenue from the service contract needs to offset this.

#### When does this model work well?

This model works well for companies that are able to leverage customer data from in-product sensors to more efficiently service products than competitors that don’t have access to the same data.

**Key factor to consider in choosing this business model:**

* **Shift in customer engagement processes.** If your customer service employees traditionally have engaged customers exclusively during infrequent sales cycles, you may need to retrain your customer service personnel on how to manage an ongoing customer relationship and set up service-level agreements.

#### Who does it well?

Cutting-edge food processor and packager Tetra Pak offers additional services that positively impact cost savings and the environment. Sensors on more than 5,000 Tetra Pak filling machines at customer sites, all connected to Microsoft Azure, feed real-time performance data—nearly 700 million data points each year—to the company for monitoring and analysis to intelligently service the product.7

Through its service contracts, Tetra Pak is able to use this data to streamline machine diagnostics and repairs for its customers, cutting repair time, or preventing failures altogether, and increasing uptime on its equipment.

(MCB) This seems like a pretty good idea for a demo but I'm not sure how much time I'd want to spend presenting it versus a quick review of it.  My biggest concern is that an ideal demo here I think would be a discussion, but it's very possible that the people in the room won't necessarily either know the answer or be able to answer (especially in a mixed-customer class) - but it's very possible I'm not properly understanding the goal of the demo.
