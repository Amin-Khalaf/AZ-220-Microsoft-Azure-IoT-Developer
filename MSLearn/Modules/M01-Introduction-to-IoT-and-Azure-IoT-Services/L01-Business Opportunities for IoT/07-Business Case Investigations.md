# Business Case Investigations

As you might imagine, IoT can be implemented in both small and large businesses, and in nearly any type of business as well. Some of the industry verticals that have a high adoption rate are listed here:

* Manufacturing
* Smart City
* Smart Building
* Healthcare
* Energy
* Transportation and Smart Vehicles
* Logistics and Inventory Management
* Retail
* Agriculture

The sections below investigate a number of these verticals in more detail.

## IoT For Manufacturing

Instrumenting a factory floor with IoT devices can enable factory managers and line workers to better anticipate problems, understand where critical systems are failing and improve the overall operation of a single factory or a network of factories around the world. The following list describes benefits of a connected factory solution.

* Monitor manufacturing equipment: Improve processes using industrial IoT. Use sensors and advanced analytics to predict needed maintenance, and reduce unplanned downtime cutting into production time. See <https://blogs.microsoft.com/iot/2016/04/29/intelligent-manufacturing-takes-plant-operations-to-the-next-level-of-iot/>

* Monitor customer equipment: Create new business models that offer predictive maintenance and performance monitoring for the equipment you produce, delivering a richer customer experience.

* Improve field service: Access sensor data to improve field service scheduling, ensuring the right technicians and tools are dispatched before potential issues become a major problem.

In addition to the general benefits listed above, IoT for manufacturing can be associated with the following implementations:

* **Capitalize on the factory of the future**: The factory of the future is enabling companies to seize new opportunities by expanding their value chain, implementing more agile production, and discovering new revenue streams. At the center of this change is IoTâ€™s ability to transform the entire connected manufacturing ecosystem, from R&D, through the supply chain, to customer service. See <https://enterprise.microsoft.com/en-us/trends/the-factory-of-the-future/>

* **Competing in the Digital Age of Manufacturing**: Operational technology and information technology are coming together for the first time, creating new opportunities for digital manufacturers. Connected products, people, and things produce terabytes of data every day that manufacturers can access and extract deep insights to optimize business and manufacturing processes better than ever before. More importantly, insight from this data helps manufacturers identify new revenue streams by developing high-value service offerings focused on how products and customers interact in the real world. This transformation is changing the landscape for manufacturers, enabling them to differentiate themselves, achieve operational excellence and disrupt markets.

* **The Connected Factory**: An IoT-enabled factory will use devices that communicate with each other and the cloud to capture and collect real-time data to enable a more efficient and productive factory. At a very high level, a connected factory will use IoT devices to communicate machine information with other machines as well as cloud services, collect and store data from those machines, and enable the creation of reports and alerts.

## IoT for Healthcare

It may seem odd to think of healthcare as an industry since it's in the "business" of dealing with life and death, but the reality is that there is a lot of money involved in providing healthcare and finding ways to do more with less is a constant goal. But IoT has the potential for impacting much more than the economics of healthcare. IoT has the potential to be a disrupter in this vertical by providing better optimization of equipment and personnel, enable non-traditional options for self care, and help monitor and maintain essential equipment used in providing care.

* **Personalized Healthcare**: While there are many potential applications for IoT in the healthcare industry, applying solutions can be tricky as concerns about patient privacy, misdiagnoses, security breaches, and malfunctioning equipment can make patients and doctors hesitant about adopting the technology. When architecting an IoT solution for healthcare that involves direct patient interaction, special care has to be taken to account for these factors.

* **Short-term care planning**: Providing patients with a plan for self care once they leave a medical facility as well as reminding patients of their plan and monitoring how well they're following that plan is one scenario the reports calls out as an area ripe for IoT solutions. For example, an app on a mobile device or wearable that can help remind patients to take medication or follow a physical therapy routine and monitor how often they follow those instructions can help healthcare providers understand challenges, prepare for follow up visits, and create modifications to a plan that may be more effective for specific patients.

* **Chronic-disease management and home care**: IoT devices and services can help those in long-term care, chronic-disease management and in frail condition to give health-care providers real-time information on their condition (e.g. an elderly person that has fallen or a diabetic whose glucose levels have reached critical levels). And the collection of data across hundreds of thousands of patients can help healthcare providers build models that will service new patients in the future.

* **Population-based evidence creation**: Big data collected by IoT systems can help healthcare providers better understand health trends across populations and be used to prevent disease rather than merely manage it.

## IoT for Retail

In today's world, the topic of IoT is often introduced in the context of connected stores that use RFID tags to monitor inventory and enable a cashless payment system. Retail has the potential to offer the easiest entry point for an IoT developer since the vertical is so massive in both scope and opportunity. From vending machines to signage, the potential for IoT to disrupt the retail experience--for sellers and consumers--is massive.

 While there are others, we can define four main benefits that IoT solutions offer to retailers and customers:

* **Operational Efficiency**: As we saw with IoT for Manufacturing, in the retail space, IoT can enable retailers to optimize their staff, delivery, security, and other parts of their supply chain. This can ensure the right products are on the shelf at the right time, that customers are kept safe at all hours of the day or night, and that theft and loss are kept to a minimum. Equipping shipping containers that enable stores to track product availability, using cloud-enabled web cameras and using mobile devices to enable easier communication with staff and track their hours can reduce the overall load retailers are burdened with.

* **Inventory Management**: In a [paper](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/internet-of-things/solution-briefs/smart-retail-solutions-top-10.html) outlining the benefits of IoT for the retail experience, Intel makes the claim that IoT can help retailers "achieve near-100-percent inventory accuracy." And this isn't merely about preventing loss. Using big data, retailers can ensure that products customers want and care about are always on the shelf and items purchased less often don't consume valuable shelf space.

* **Improved Customer Experience**: As we saw above with the Amazon Go store experience, customers can benefit from IoT solutions in retail by being able to purchase the products they want with less friction. By eliminating checkout lines and eliminating the need for customers to carry cash or credit cards, customers get more time back and can be safer shopping. Of course, privacy is always a concern in these scenarios so IoT architects need to take great care to find the right balance between technical advances and privacy concerns.

* **Cost Efficiency and Savings**: Each of the items listed above should result in more efficient operations and reduce costs in terms of both running the business and supporting customers. The idea is that retailers can not only outfit the retail experience with an IoT architecture but outfit the stores themselves to make retail operations "smart". More on this in the section discussing smart buildings.

## IoT for Smart Cities and Buildings

If you've installed and usd any one of the many "smart home" devices on the market today, you may already be seeing the potential value of a smart home: improved safety through lock monitoring, automatic lighting, and security cameras and increased productivity and efficiency through home automation. These consumer scenarios, when extrapolated to the scale of a town or city, give us an idea of what is possible to make the places where we live, work, and play safer and more efficient.

While the architects of IoT solutions need to consider the right balance between innovation and personal privacy, the opportunities to improve civic life through IoT are enormous and, with proper controls and privacy considerations in place, can make communities safer, more efficient, and easier to live in.

* **Optimize natural resource use**: Making better use of natural resources is more than a political slogan. Doing more with less makes good economic sense (as any successful business person can attest to) and makes for better stewardship in using the resources we have. IoT implementations can help the citizens of cities minimize waste, use power more intelligently, and make the best use of resources for farming, mining, and energy.

* **Create safer cities**: City life is a buzzing array of complex variables that are under continual change. While cities to have a "heartbeat" and rhythm, the regularity is a product of a variety of individual activities all occurring at the same time. From an IoT perspective, this can create a data management and analytics challenge. But it also creates a lot of problems for city managers:

  * How does a city ensure emergency services have enough resources to meet the demands of the city?
  * How do managers of those emergency resources deploy the resources in the most efficient ways to keep citizens safe?
  * How does a city manage high demand (say for a significant weather event)?
  * Does demand vary based on the time of the day or the time of the year?

* **Create smart buildings**: As we've been seeing in the other verticals, IoT technology can bring value to a segment or vertical by collecting and aggregating data for insights that formerly would have been hidden without the data collection. These insights can help enable cost savings, efficiency, and even comfort and safety. All these are true when it comes to smart buildings.

* **Improve field service**: A "smart city" can provide quicker and more efficient services for public equipment and utilities. Providing the ability for municipalities and service providers to instrument equipment, get data, and respond to problems, can make cities safer and make life better in the city. From repairing street lamps and roadways to monitoring and anticipating problems in public utilities, IoT can help cities better maintain their infrastructure and respond to problems.

## IoT for Transportation and Logistics

Transportation advances are perhaps the most exciting area where IoT solutions are being developed. Getting from one place to another can be an arduous, frustrating, and sometimes dangerous thing to do. Anyone who has spent more than an hour sitting in traffic has said to themselves, "There has to be a better way." What makes this vertical so exciting is the many opportunities for improvement and innovation it presents.

Autonomous vehicles and self-driving cars is only a small part of the opportunity that this segment of IoT can address. As we saw in the "smart city" discussion, transportation must be be viewed as an ecosystem where each of the parts are working together. The more complex the variables in that ecosystem, the more complex the solution will be.

And while economics is a factor in transportation solutions, governments may be more interested in efficiency and safety which creates a different dynamic for solution architects compared to the other verticals we've been looking at.
