# Azure IoT Services and Technologies

Microsoft has built a portfolio that supports the needs of all customers, enabling everyone to access the benefits of digital transformation. The Azure IoT product portfolio is an overview of the available PaaS/SaaS technologies and solutions.

## Solutions

Get started quickly with solution accelerators and SaaS offerings. Choose from preconfigured solutions that enable common IoT scenarios, such as remote monitoring, predictive maintenance, and connected factory, to create a fully customizable solution. Or use Azure IoT Central, a fully managed, end-to-end solution that enables powerful IoT scenarios without requiring cloud-solution expertise.

### Azure IoT solution accelerators (PaaS)

Azure IoT solution accelerators are customizable PaaS solutions that provide a high level of control over your IoT solution. If your business is implementing IoT for connected operations or has specific customization requirements for connected products, Azure IoT solution accelerators provide the control you need.

Organizations with a large number of devices or device models, and manufacturers seeking connected factory solutions, are examples of companies that can benefit from IoT solution accelerators.

### Azure IoT Central (SaaS)

Azure IoT Central is a fully managed SaaS solution, which allows you to get started quickly with minimal IoT experience. If your business is pursuing speed over customization, SaaS models could be the perfect fit for your IoT implementation needs.
Organizations with fewer device models, more predictable scenarios, and limited IoT/IT capabilities can now reap the benefits of IoT through a SaaS approach. Businesses that previously lacked the time, money, and expertise to develop connected products, can now get started quickly with Azure IoT Central. Microsoft is leading the industry in providing a mature SaaS solution that addresses common IoT implementation requirements.

## Technologies (PaaS)

With the most comprehensive IoT portfolio of platform services, Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) technologies that span the Azure platform enable you to easily create, customize, and control all aspects of your IoT solution. Establish bi-directional communications with billions of IoT devices and manage your IoT devices at scale. Then integrate your IoT device data with other platform services, such as Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Time Series Insights, to enhance insights across your solution.

### Device support

Get started on your IoT project with confidence by leveraging Azure IoT Starter Kits or choosing from hundreds of Certified for IoT devices in the device catalog. All devices are platform-agnostic and tested to connect seamlessly to IoT Hub. Connect all your devices to Azure IoT using the open-source device SDKs. The SDKs support multiple operating systems, such as Linux, Windows, and real-time operating systems, as well as multiple programming languages, such as C, Node.js, Java, .NET, and Python.

### IoT Hub

Azure IoT Hub is a fully managed service that enables reliable and secure bidirectional communications between millions of IoT devices and a solution back end. The Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service is a helper service for IoT Hub that enables zero-touch, just-in-time provisioning to the right IoT hub without requiring human intervention, enabling customers to provision millions of devices in a secure and scalable manner.

### IoT Edge

Azure IoT Edge is an IoT service. This service is meant for customers who want to analyze data on devices, a.k.a. "at the edge." By moving parts of your workload to the edge, you will experience reduced latency and have the option for off-line scenarios.

### Spatial Intelligence

Azure Digital Twins is an IoT service that enables you to create a model of a physical environment. It provides a spatial intelligence graph to model the relationships between people, spaces, and devices. By corelating data across the digital and physical world you can create contextually aware solutions.

### Data and analytics

Take advantage of an array of Azure data and analytics PaaS offerings in your IoT solution, from bringing cloud intelligence to the edge with Azure Machine Learning, to storing IoT device data in a cost-effective way with Azure Data Lake, to visualizing huge amount of data from IoT devices with Azure Time Series Insights.

(MCB) I know why this is here, but if there is a slide on this, I admit I'd probably just skip it, because I hate "pure marketing" slides.
