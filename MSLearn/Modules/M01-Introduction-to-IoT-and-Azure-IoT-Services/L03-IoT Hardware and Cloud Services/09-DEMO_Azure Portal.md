**Instructor Notes**

Need to help students with:

* accounts and subscriptions
* navigation within the portal
* costs and other considerations for this course

(MCB) We should consider explicitly calling out demoing whatever will be seen in the lab if possible, and calling out what takes time to create and thus should be pre-staged in "cooking show" format vs. what can be waited on.  There's also the risk of students not knowing basic Azure stuff like resource groups and getting bogged down here on that.  It's a big problematic to demo IoT Hub creation though when the tiers are explained later.
