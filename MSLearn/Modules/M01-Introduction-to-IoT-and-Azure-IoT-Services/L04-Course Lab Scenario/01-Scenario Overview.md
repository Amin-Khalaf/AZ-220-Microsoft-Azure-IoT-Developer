# Course Overview

In this course, we will spend most of our time focused on the Azure Platform-as-a-Service tools for IoT, but we will also take a little time to become familiar with IoT Central, Microsoftâ€™s Software-as-a-Service alternative. Understanding how to create an IoT solution using each of these tools will help you to determine when to implement one over the other for your company and/or customers.

The course begins with an overview of IoT and Azure IoT tools as they apply to businesses interested in getting started with IoT. We will be using Azure IoT platform services such as Azure IoT Hub and the Device Provisioning Services, in conjunction with Azure IoT SDKs and various other tools, to build a custom Azure IoT solution from scratch. To finish up the course, we will be using IoT Central to build and deploy a second IoT solution. 

## Lab Scenario

During the hands-on labs, you will be acting in the role of an Azure IoT Developer helping to create IoT solutions. You are employed by Contoso, a global company that specializes in making and selling gourmet cheese. At Contoso, you are prepared to start your digital transformation journey, with the goal of improving processes throughout the company. This will include the factory floors where you produce your cheese, your fleet of vehicles used to transport your products, your warehouse facilities, and your facilities used for aging and storing cheese.

To get started, you will set up an Azure subscription and become familiar with the Azure IoT services. Getting your Azure portal set up and examining Azure IoT services will help you to work more efficiently when you start building your IoT solution. You will also work on setting up your development environment, another important step to take before starting work on your IoT solution.

Contoso has become known for producing top quality cheeses, which has led to rapid growth in popularity and sales. You need to ensure that your cheese products stay at the same high level of quality. This means that the conditions at your factory floor, cheese aging facilities, and during transportation to customers all need to be strictly controlled as your business expands and production increases.
