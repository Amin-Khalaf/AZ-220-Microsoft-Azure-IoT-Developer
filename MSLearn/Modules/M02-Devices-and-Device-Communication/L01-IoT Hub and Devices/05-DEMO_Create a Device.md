**Instructor Notes**

The placement of this demo within the lesson topic sequence is open to discussion. The perceived advantage for completing the demo early is that it provides the instructor with the opportunity to open the device blade in the portal and discuss the device properties/features/tasks that are exposed in the UI (Device Twins, Modules, etc.)

(MCB) of course this assumes there is an IoT Hub there to demo against, which means the earlier IoT Hub demo should point out that there's a later demo that needs it.
