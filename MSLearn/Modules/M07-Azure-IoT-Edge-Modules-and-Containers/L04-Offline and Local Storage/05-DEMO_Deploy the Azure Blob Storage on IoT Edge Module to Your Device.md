[Deploy the Azure Blob Storage on IoT Edge module to your device](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/how-to-deploy-blob)

The Azure Blob Storage documentation includes quickstart sample code in several languages. You can run these samples to test Azure Blob Storage on IoT Edge by changing the blob endpoint to connect to your local blob storage module. The quickstart samples use languages that are also supported by IoT Edge, so you could deploy them as IoT Edge modules alongside the blob storage module: [Quickstart: Azure Blob storage client library v12 for .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-dotnet)
