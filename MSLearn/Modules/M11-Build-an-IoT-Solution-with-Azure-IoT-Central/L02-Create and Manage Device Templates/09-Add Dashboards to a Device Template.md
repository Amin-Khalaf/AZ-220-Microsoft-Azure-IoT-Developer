# Add Dashboards to a Device Template

Add dashboards to a device template to enable operators to visualize a device by using charts and metrics. You can have multiple dashboards for a device template.

To add a dashboard to a device template:

1. Go to your device template, and select **Views**.

1. Choose **Visualizing the Device**.

1. Enter a name for your dashboard in **Dashboard Name**.

1. Add tiles to your dashboard from the list of static, property, cloud property, telemetry, and command tiles. 

    Drag and drop the tiles you want to add to your dashboard.

    To plot multiple telemetry values on a single chart tile, select the telemetry values, and then select **Combine**.

    You can configure each tile to customize how it displays data.

1. Arrange and resize the tiles on your dashboard.

1. Save the changes.

## Configure preview device to view dashboard

To view and test your dashboard, select Configure preview device. This enables you to see the dashboard as your operator sees it after it's published. Use this option to validate that your views show the correct data. You can choose from the following:

* No preview device.
* The real test device you've configured for your device template.
* An existing device in your application, by using the device ID.
