1. Scenario is a sensor device that is in a transport box. (the same device in labs in the first labs). We want to view both in truck and planes to compare the two. Let's update lab to reflect the scenario of when the spikes happen when the device was in the truck vs the plane: _Asset condition tracking revealed a spike in temperature for a specific asset, we want to find the root cause. We want to understand what happened: we correlate the asset tracking device's sensor data from transportation trucks and planes sensors. The temperature in one of the trucks rose and created the heat spike in my box: we will make sure transporter uses a truck that maintains temperature in the future.._ - PC
