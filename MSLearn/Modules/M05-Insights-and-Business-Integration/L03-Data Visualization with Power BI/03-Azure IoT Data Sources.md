# Connect to Azure IoT Data Sources

Data types are organized in the following categories:

## Azure Data Connections

The **Azure** category provides the following data connections:

* Azure SQL Database
* Azure SQL Data Warehouse
* Azure Analysis Services database
* Azure Blob Storage
* Azure Table Storage
* Azure Cosmos DB
* Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (Beta)

## Connect to data

To connect to your data source, select **Get Data** on the **Home** ribbon. The Get Data window appears, where you can choose from the many different data sources to which Power BI Desktop can connect.

Once you have selected your data source, Power BI Desktop opens the Navigator window, where you can choose which data you would like to load into Power BI Desktop.

After you have selected the data that will be using for visualizations, a Fields pane is used to access the data.

(MCB) I feel like the only things to mention here should be the IoT related items e. g. cost management isn't really important here, is it?
