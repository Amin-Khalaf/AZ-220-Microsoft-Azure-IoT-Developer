# Data Visualization in Power BI

Visualizations (known as visuals for short) display insights that have been discovered in the data. A Power BI report might have a single page with one visual or it might have pages full of visuals. In the Power BI service, visuals can be pinned from reports to dashboards.

It's important to make the distinction between report designers and report consumers. If you are the person building or modifying the report, then you are a designer. Designers have edit permissions to the report and its underlying dataset. In Power BI Desktop, this means you can open the dataset in Data view and create visuals in Report view. In Power BI service, this means you can open the data set or report in the report editor in Editing view. If a report or dashboard has been shared with you , you are a report consumer. You'll be able to view and interact with the report and its visuals but you won't be able to make as many changes as a designer can.

## Power BI Visualizations

There are many different visual types available directly from the Power BI Visualizations pane.

|Visualization|Description|
|-------------|-----------|
|Area charts:<br>Basic (Layered) and Stacked|The Basic Area chart is based on the line chart with the area between the axis and line filled in.|
|Bar and column charts|Bar charts are the standard for looking at a specific value across different categories.|
|Cards: Multi row<br>Cards: Single number|A Card is used when it is important to track a single number or value.|
|Combo charts|A Combo chart combines a column chart and a line chart. Choose from Line and Stacked Column and Line and Clustered Column.|
|Doughnut charts|Doughnut charts are similar to Pie charts. They show the relationship of parts to a whole.|
|Funnel charts|Funnels help visualize a process that has stages and items flow sequentially from one stage to the next. Use a funnel when there is a sequential flow between stages, such as a sales process that starts with leads and ends with purchase fulfillment.|
|Gauge charts|Displays current status in the context of a goal.|
|Key influencers chart|A key influencer chart displays the major contributors to a selected result or value.|
|KPIs|Displays progress toward a measurable goal.|
|Line charts|Emphasize the overall shape of an entire series of values, usually over time.|
|Maps: Basic maps|Used to associate both categorical and quantitative information with spatial locations.|
|Maps: ArcGIS maps|Use when you want to layer data over a regional map. For example, layer symbols that represent demographic measures over a regional area to show value desities|
|Maps: Filled maps (Choropleth)|The more intense the color, the larger the value.|
|Maps: Shape maps|Compares regions by color.|
|Matrix|A table supports two dimensions, but a matrix makes it easier to display data meaningfully across multiple dimensions -- it supports a stepped layout. The matrix automatically aggregates the data and enables drill down.|
|Pie charts|Pie charts show the relationship of parts to a whole.|
|Q&A visual|Similar to the Q&A experience on dashboards, the Q&A visual lets you ask questions about your data using natural language.|
|R script visuals|Visuals created with R scripts, commonly called R visuals, can present advanced data shaping and analytics such as forecasting, using the rich analytics and visualization power of R. R visuals can be created in Power BI Desktop and published to the Power BI service.|
|Ribbon chart|Ribbon charts show which data category has the highest rank (largest value). Ribbon charts are effective at showing rank change, with the highest range (value) always displayed on top for each time period.|
|Scatter and Bubble charts|Display relationships between 2 (scatter) or 3 (bubble) quantitative measures -- whether or not, in which order, etc.|
|Scatter-high density|Too many data points on a visual can bog it down, so a sophisticated sampling algorithm is used to ensure the accuracy of the visualization.|
|Slicers|A slicer is used to narrow the portion of the dataset shown in other visualizations in a report.|
|Standalone images|Used to display a static image, such as a company logo|
|Tables|Work well with quantitative comparisons among items where there are many categories.|
|Treemaps|Charts of colored rectangles, with size representing value. They can be hierarchical, with rectangles nested within the main rectangles.|
|Waterfall charts|Waterfall charts show a running total as values are added or subtracted.|
