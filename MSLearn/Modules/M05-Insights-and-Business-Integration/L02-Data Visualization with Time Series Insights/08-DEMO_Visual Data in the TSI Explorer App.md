Microsoft hosts a sandbox environment of the TSI Explorer that has been pre-populated with tens of millions of rows of time series data. The site has a built-in introduction / tutorial and then allows you to explore and experiment.  You could use this demo to provide students with a quick tour of TSI.

**Note**: This demo is built for a different scenario than the main one we will be using for this course. It analyzes three factories with 16 total machines.  

Demo can be found here [time series insights demo](https://insights.timeseries.azure.com/demo). Use your Microsoft identity (such as an Office 365 login) to connect. It provides a hands-on tour of many of the main components of the TSI Explorer: the **Time selection panel**, the **Terms panel**, the chart region, the events grid, the export capabilities, the series filter... and more.
