# Introduction to Lambda Architecture

There are several distinct purposes of recording telemetry readings generated by IoT devices:

- To be analyzed for anomalies, for preventive maintenance.
- For visualization by a remote human operator, to help in decision making.
- To be archived, perhaps for later analysis.

These distinct purposes have conflicting storage requirements. However, having conflicting goals doesn't need to be a bad thing. Conflicting goals for data storage lead us to hybrid systems, which can be very flexible and powerful. 

This lesson describes the hybrid nature of the IoT lambda architecture and provides an introduction to data storage option for Azure IoT solutions.

## Data paths

The conflict in Azure IoT is as follows. Telemetry data is coming in hot, there's lots of it, and it needs to be analyzed quickly. Preventive maintenance is the goal of this analysis. Also, all the data should be stored, both to archive it, and to run some deeper analysis over longer time periods. The deeper analysis is to try to detect longer term trends, or failure patterns, that might be difficult to detect with a shorter real-time sample.

One of the easiest ways of handling this duality at the device sensor end of things, is to send two messages. The first message contains only the telemetry data that needs analyzed in real time. The second message contains the telemetry, and all the other data that might be needed for deeper analysis or archiving.

The IoT Hub routes these two messages to different resources. It's common to use the familiar terms _hot_, _warm_, _cool_, and _cold_ in data analysis. Hot clearly means a real-time approach is needed. Warm can have the same meaning, though perhaps the data is "near" real time, or at least, recent. Cool means the flow of data is slow. Cold means that the data is stored and not "flowing".

## Understand lambda architecture

The _Lambda architecture_ of Azure IoT enables multiple paths. However, for the sake of explanation, let's work with two paths, hot and cold.

The hot path is the streaming telemetry routed into real-time analysis. This path is also the right path to trigger warnings and alerts.

The cold path is a batch processing path for telemetry data storage.

### The hot path

The IoT remote device pumps out _specific_ telemetry. This telemetry is sent in its own message, routed by the IoT Hub for instant analysis and visualization. The analysis could be done by a human operator, say, using Azure Time Series Insights. This approach is described in this module.

Alternatively, the analysis could be handled by Azure ML models, via Azure Stream Analytics. This scenario is more complex, involves coding, and is described in other IoT Hub Learn modules.

### The cold path

The IoT remote device also sends out all telemetry, and logging, data. The IoT Hub directs these messages down a route to an Azure storage account. There are various storage resources available in Azure, and the next units describe these options.

### Issues with lambda architecture

Similar to most hybrid systems, there are issues. One of the main ones with IoT is the duplication of data and code. The more duplication there is, the greater the chance of an unwanted divergence between the duplicate copies. Developers of the IoT device sensor code need to ensure that the telemetry data being sent in the two messages is identical, where it should be. There may be code duplication in the analysis apps for the hot and cold paths. Duplication needs to be handled carefully, though is a near unavoidable consequence of a hybrid system.

(MCB) this needs a better explanation of the terminology - where it comes from, etc.  There's also a risk for confusion where a student hears "Lambda," thinks of AWS Lambda, and goes to serverless/Azure Functions.  We need to call out that's not what we're talking about here.
