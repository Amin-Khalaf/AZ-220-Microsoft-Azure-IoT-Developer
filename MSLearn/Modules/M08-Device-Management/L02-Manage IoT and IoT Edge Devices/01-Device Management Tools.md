# Device Management Tools

There are three primary tools that we will be using to manage devices in this course, and the good news is that you are already familiam with them.

## IoT Hub (Azure portal)

The Azure portal can be used to implement device management in the following ways:

* Update Device Twin properties and tags for a device
* Invoke a Direct Method on a device
* Implement Automatic Device Management

## Azure CLI

Azure CLI and the Azure CLI extension for IoT commands can be used to implement device management in the following ways:

* Update Device Twin properties and tags for a device
* Invoke a Direct Method on a device
* Perform Device Twin queries across devices

## VS Code 

Visual Studio Code and the Azure IoT Tools extension can be used to implement device management in the following ways:

* Create device code (such as direct methods or code used to help manage devices using device twin properties)
* Create backend apps (to support specific management tasks as well as jobs that support management at scale)
