# Setup the Development Environment

## Lab Scenario

As one of the developers at Contoso, you know that setting up your development environment is an important step before starting to build your Azure IoT solution. You know that Microsoft provides a number of tools that can be used to develop and support your IoT solutions and that some decisions should be made about which tools your team will use. You will prepare a work environment that the team can use to develop your IoT solution, both on the Azure cloud side and for your local work environment.

After some discussion, your team has made the following high-level decisions about the dev environment:

* Operating System: Windows 10 will be used as the OS. Windows is used by most of your team, so it was a logical choice. You note that Azure IoT services support other operating systems (such as Mac OS and Linux), and Microsoft provides supporting documentation for those members of the team who choose one of these alternatives.
* General Coding Tools: Visual Studio Code and Azure CLI will be used as the primary coding tools. Both of these tools support extensions for IoT that leverage the Azure IoT SDKs.
* IoT Edge Tools: Docker Desktop Community and Python will be used to support custom IoT Edge module development.

In support of these decisions, you will be setting up the following environment:

* Windows 10 64-bit: Pro, Enterprise, or Education (Build 15063 or later). Including
  * 4GB â€“ 8GB system RAM (higher the better for Docker)
  * Hyper-V and Containers features of Windows must be enabled.
  * BIOS-level hardware virtualization support must be enabled in the BIOS settings.

  > **Note**: When setting up the development environment on a virtual machine, the VM environment must support nested virtualization - [nested virtualization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/nested-virtualization)

* Azure CLI (current/latest)
* .NET Core 3.0.100 (or later) SDK
* VS Code (latest)
* Python 3.7 (not 3.8)
* Docker Desktop Community 2.1.0.5 (or later) set to Linux Containers
* Power BI Desktop (for data visualization)
* IoT Extensions for VS Code and Azure CLI

> **Note**: A virtual machine has been created for this course that provides a majority of the tools specified above. The instructions below support using the prepared VM or setting up the development environment locally using your PC.

## In This Lab

In this lab you will:

* Install the base tools and products that will be used during the labs in this course.
* Install the Azure IoT extensions for Azure CLI and Visual Studio Code.
* Verify your development environment setup

### Exercise 3: Set Up Course Lab Files and Alternative Tools

A number of the labs in this course rely on pre-built resources, such as a code project that can be used as a starting point for the lab activity. We provide access to these lab resources through the use of a GitHub project. In addition to resources that directly support the course labs (the resources contained in the GitHub project), there are tools that can be used to support learning opportunities outside the actual course. The instructions below lead you through the configuration of both these resource types.

#### Task 1: Download Course Lab Files

Microsoft has created a GitHub repo to provide access to lab resource files. Having these files local to the dev environment is required in some cases and convenient in many others. In this task you will be downloading and extracting the contents of the repo within your development environment.

1. In your Web browser, navigate to the following location: [https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-220-Microsoft-Azure-IoT-Developer](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-220-Microsoft-Azure-IoT-Developer)

1. On the right side of the page, click **Clone or download**, and then click **Download ZIP**.

1. To save the ZIP file to your dev environment, click **Save**.

1. Once the file has been saved, click **Open folder**.

1. Right-click the saved ZIP file, and then click **Extract all**

1. Click **Browse**, and then navigate to folder location that is convenient to access.

1. To extract the files, click **Extract**.

    Be sure to make not of where you located the files.

#### Task 2: Install Azure PowerShell

> **Note**: The lab activities in this course do NOT have you using PowerShell, however, you may see sample code in reference documents that use PowerShell. If you want to run PowerShell code, you can use the following instructions to complete the installation steps.

Azure PowerShell is designed for managing and administering Azure resources from the command line, and for building automation scripts that work against the Azure Resource Manager. You can use it in your browser with Azure Cloud Shell, or you can install it on your local machine and use it in any PowerShell session. If you are running Azure PowerShell locally, you need to have Windows PowerShell configured.

1. On the Windows 10 Start menu, to begin installing the Azure PowerShell tools, right-click **Windows Powershell**, and then click **Run as Administrator**.

    Administrator rights are required to install PowerShell modules, so you will need to run as an administrator to get started.

1. At the command prompt, to determine the version of PowerShellGet installed on your computer, enter the following command:

    `Get-Module -Name PowerShellGet -ListAvailable | Select-Object -Property Name,Version,Path`

    PowerShellGet should be installed by default with Windows 10. However, to install the Azure PowerShell module, you will need PowerShellGet version 1.1.2.0 or higher.

1. If you are running an older version of PowerShellGet (such as version 1.0.0.1), to update PowerShellGet, enter the following command:

    `Install-Module PowerShellGet -Force`

    It will take a moment for your computer to respond.

    If you are prompted to install a newer version of the NuGet provider, type **Y** and then press Enter.

    > **Note**:  If you re-run the command that we used above to determine the installed version of PowerShellGet, you should see that PowerShellGet version 1.6.0 (or higher) is now installed.

1. To install the Azure Resource Manager modules from the PowerShell Gallery, enter the following command:

    `Install-Module -Name AzureRM -AllowClobber`

    If you see a message stating that "You are installing the modules from an untrusted repository", type **A** and then press Enter.

    > **Note**:  Once again, it can take a minute for the installation to begin, so just give it a chance.

    The AzureRM module is a rollup module for the Azure Resource Manager cmdlets. When you install the AzureRM module, any Azure PowerShell module not previously installed is downloaded and installed from the PowerShell Gallery.

1. Close the version of PowerShell that is running at elevated privileges, and then open a PowerShell session at a normal privilege level.

    Once the AzureRM module is installed, you need to load the module into your PowerShell session. It is best to do this in a normal (non-elevated) PowerShell session.

1. To load the modules using the Import-Module cmdlet, enter the following command:

    `Import-Module -Name AzureRM`

    We will be providing detailed instructions for using the Azure PowerShell tools during the labs in this course, but if you want more information now, see [Getting started with Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/get-started-azureps?view=azurermps-5.7.0)
